This class can be used in any projects. If you need a variable scrollbar in an input textfield, just use it! You can personnalise the color, position and of course replace the cursor as a clip.
When you write some text in the input textfield, if the text exceed the height of the textfield, a scrollbar will appear on the right of the textfield. This is automatic!

Check the example to set it up!
